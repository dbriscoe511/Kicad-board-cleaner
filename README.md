# Kicad-board-cleaner. 
Avalible via the kicad content manager.  


Allows user to remove designator silkscreen and values to clean up high density boards. Allows the user to input a list of designators to remove, such as [R,C,L,D], and hides the silkscreen and or values labels for all parts that match the designator.

Note: this feature is avalible in kicad 6.0 under Edit->Edit Text & Graphics properties, so this plugin is obsolete.
